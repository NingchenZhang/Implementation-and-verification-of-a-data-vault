This is a readme for the semester project 2022 about DataVault
My program can create the Enterprise layer successfully and Successfully read dataset1 into the database

******
The database is created by the python use package named psycopg2. I asked teacher and it was confirmed 
that using python to create the database was allowed. So There are two python file in the code folder.
After running the datavault.py file the table can be seen in PgAdmin 4.

First,Use PgAdmin to create an empty database named 'smdvault'(If it exists, ignore it).And then 
to excute dataVault.py file.The program should input the information like database name password etc. Because different people have
different requirement for database name or password. Just follow the prompts input the information. 
Normally we input the database named 'smdvault' that we just created in pgAdmin 4.
